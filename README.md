## Intro
<p> This is my second project using Bootstrap. I think bootstrap or other libraries have advantages that make it easier and there are also difficulties in using bootstrap. After I used it in this project I felt there were significant difficulties even though the bootstrap also made my job quite easy.</p>

## How to instal
1. Download this project or you can clone ``` git clone https://github.com/bamboo110/bootstrap-freak.git ```
2. Open this folder
3. open index.html on your browser
